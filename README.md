# TFE-RoA Compatch

Things to do:

 :blue_square: Need to search through TFE files for how they reference and use their duchy/county titles to determine whether we will use the RoA map as a base, or if the duchies/counties/baronies will need to be changed to use TFE titles and regions

 :blue_square: Redo TFE regions to use RoA map
 
 :blue_square: Redo TFE titles to use RoA counties/duchies as a base
 
 :blue_square: Redo TFE script files to make sure any reference to specific titles/regions use the corrected ones
