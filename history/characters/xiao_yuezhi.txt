# XIAO YUEZHI
# 
# When the Yuezhi were defeated by the Xiongnu during the Han Dynasty, they split into two groups.
# The larger group, the Da Yuezhi or Great Yuezhi, fled westward and *probably* became the later Kushans.
# A smaller group, the Xiao Yuezhi or Lesser Yuezhi, sought shelter with various Qiang tribes in Qinghai.
# Their descendants may have endured into the late Han period and possibly beyond, adopting Qiang customs
# and gradually assimilating into Qiang, Xiongnu, and Han populations. For example, the Yuezhi monk Dharmarakṣa
# who was from Dunhuang and flourished in the 4th century may have been of Little Yuezhi extraction.
# Meanwhile, the Lu Shuihu branch of Xiongnu (from which the Juqu of Northern Liang hail) could have been partly Yuezhi too.
# Due to the ambiguity of these non-Chinese ethnicities, it's hard to say for sure if the Lesser Yuezhi
# survived in any recognizable form into late antiquity. Their presence here is speculative and should not
# be assumed to be true or the scholarly consensus, like with many issues of ethnicity in this period.
