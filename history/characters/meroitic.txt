# Note: The chronology of Kushite rulers after Yesebokheamani is extremely uncertain.
# Attested names could be local warlords/officials/chiefs or actual rulers, it is hard to say.
# I have therefore done a plausible sequence of rulers, but it should NOT be understood as accurate.
# This is merely a convenience for gameplay purposes to give some background for the final Kushite rulers.
# So that they are at least not some made up fantasy rulers.

# Cybrxkhan:
# Amanipilade is a very late ruler of Meroe attested in an offering table dating to c. 350 CE, unknown if male or female.
# It is hard to even say if he or she was an actual King of Kush, ruler of a rump state.
# It is possible Amanipilade was just a local chief/noble/official who adopted royal elements in the offering table.
# Pyramid Beg N. 25 is the last known Meroitic Pyramid dedicated to a ruler, which is cautiously confirmed to be that of a queen.
# It has been theorized that if Amanipilade *was* the final Kushite ruler, and is the same as the ruler who built Beg N. 25, then she was a queen.
# I thus go with the interpretation of Amanipilade as the final (known) queen of Meroe, but this is highly speculative and not guaranteed fact.
