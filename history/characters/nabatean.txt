# Wahb'el, an Arab traveler or nomad who is attested in a historiographically important inscription found in the Jordanian desert
# Because it is possibly the earliest attestation of Jesus/Christianity in an Arabic context
# It was written in the Safaitic script, which went extinct around or after the 4th century
# Wahb'el may have been a sedentary/city Arab who was traveling through, or a nomad from the region
# His maternal side was connected to the Ashlalite tribes, as the inscription is about Wahb'el grieving for his uncle
# Because Wahb'el was using an almost extinct script for a religion just spreading among the Arabs, he may have been a convert
