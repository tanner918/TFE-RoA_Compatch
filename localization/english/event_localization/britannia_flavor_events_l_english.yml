 britannia_flavor.0001.desc:0 "A messenger came to me this afternoon with interesting news from [kent.GetNameNoTier].\n\nHe said that one of those self-claimed Roman noblemen tried opening up a new silver mine around Maegdanstane - a rock-speaking fool. It just so happens that one of his workers had their ragged clothes snag on this hard grey rock deposit in their mine. The nobleman now claims he’s found a rich stretch of the rock that they used to quarry for building churches in the cities.\n\nPerhaps something can and should be done to benefit from this ragstone, as they call it."
 britannia_flavor.0001.a:0 "Building materials are sparse. Take control of the mine!"
 britannia_flavor.0001.b:0 "Perhaps a Roman knowledgeable about the area can help us."
 britannia_flavor.0001.b.tooltip:0 "A capable Britano-Roman character will join your court as a guest"
 britannia_flavor.0001.c:0 "There are more useful ventures elsewhere."

 britannia_flavor.0002.desc:0 "We have struck bone!\n\nThe local miners at Maegdanstane in [kent.GetNameNoTier] broke through a weak section of the rock and revealed great bones buried in the earth. The Romanish men there claim that the bones belong to the Giants who lived before a great flood!\n\nBah! My men say these instead belong to the wyrms of the world, who spit fire and ravage the lands."
 britannia_flavor.0002.a:0 "All that said, we shall let the locals have their fantasies."
 britannia_flavor.0002.b:0 "We clearly live in the land of the Dracaena."
 britannia_flavor.0002.c:0 "Cover this up before it causes any panic!"
