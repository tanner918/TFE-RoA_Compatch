 tfe_south_asia_decision.1001.desc:0 "The great Empire of the Shakas was divided into two by invading Pahlavas, and conflict with the Kushanas and Satavahanas reduced the remaining half in the West to Avanti and Saurashtra. \n\nThe union of the former Shaka Kshatrapas by me has allowed for the recreation of the old Shaka state of King Moga, and all Shakas in Shakadvipa now pray that it perseveres just as the Mahakshatrapa has for so long."

 tfe_south_asia_decision.2001.desc:0 "I sit on the throne of Maharashtra that my ancestors once sat on, and I can now truly call myself a Maharajadhiraja of the Vakataka Dynasty as are called the great Vindhyashakti and Pravarasena.\n\nOur house now takes pre-eminence over the 4 branches the Vakataka Dynasty split into, and we shall lead it to ever greater heights.\n\nMy courtiers tell me that many of my subjects have even started referring to me by Pravarasena's old title of "Dharmamaharaj"."
 tfe_south_asia_decision.2001.a:0 "Glory to the Vakataka Dynasty and to [founder.GetFirstName] Dharmamaharaja!"

 tfe_south_asia_decision.2002.t:0 "Stolen Glory"
 tfe_south_asia_decision.2002.desc:0 "[founder.GetFirstName] has declared his branch of the Vakataka Dynasty to be the true line of Vindhyashakti and Pravarasena, and hence the inheritors of their legacy and land, thereby undercutting our claim to the same.\n\nIt was a mistake to have let [founder.GetFirstName] get powerful enough to conquer all of Maharashtra, and my inability to stop them has brought shame to my family, ancestors, and descendants."

 tfe_south_asia_decision.3001.t:0 "New lands in Aryavarta"
 tfe_south_asia_decision.3001.desc:0 "Aryavarta's boundaries have never been still throughout history, but the expansion of the Arya in the south was not thought of as enough of a reason to include those lands in the definition of Aryavarta even after Chandragupta Maurya's conquests.\n\nMy actions today will change that, all the lands from the Pennar to the Oxus will now be a part of an expanded Aryavarta, and the true civilization will soon surely spread in those lands."
