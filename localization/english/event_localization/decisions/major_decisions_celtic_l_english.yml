 celtic.0001.desc:0 "After the Roman conquest of our land, the Druids were persecuted and killed by the accursed legions of a corrupt, decadent, and power-hungry empire. Today, we are free of their religious oppression and attempts at converting our lands to the teachings of Jupiter, Christ, or whatever false deity they blindly follow! The time to bring back the head of the Druids, the Myrdidin, is finally now."

 celtic.0002.desc.christian:0 "The accursed followers of [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.HighGodName] have reclaimed enough land and influence to re-establish a blasphemous priesthood under the protection of [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nIf not soon stopped, these demon-worshiping pagans might turn the tide of Christian expansion in Albion, polluting the mind of their unaware subjects with lies and perversions."
 celtic.0002.desc.others:0 "The strange, grove-worshiping followers of [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.HighGodName] have reclaimed enough of their ancestral Britannian territories to re-establish a functional Priesthood.\n\nIf not stopped soon, they might turn the tide of Christian expansion and restore Albion under the protection of their old gods."

 celtic.0004.t:0 "The Kingdom of Wales"
 celtic.0004.desc:0 "Britannia is in strife. The Romans, whether through willful abandonment or neglect out of weakness, have left this region to the wolves.

Perhaps the decline of central authority isn’t entirely a bad thing - it is also a chance for Britannia to find for itself a new destiny, which [wales_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] intends to be a part of."
