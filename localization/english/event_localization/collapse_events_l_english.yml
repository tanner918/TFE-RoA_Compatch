Unfortunately, a little more than a year into my reign, my commander, Orestes, betrayed me and set up his son on the throne. In the ensuing instability, the leader of the foederati barbarians, Odoacer, managed to usurp control of Italia. Now, I face a choice: \n\nDo I attempt to once again retake the Roman heartland, or do I retire to the safety of Illyria and content myself with nominal control over the West?"

 western_roman.0029.desc:0 "The deposed Western Emperor Nepos fled to Illyria after being betraed by his foederati. Ever since, he has plotted to regain control of Italia. As one of the few remaining claimants to the Western throne considered to be legitimate, my position as Eastern Emperor relative to him is one that requires a delicate touch. Recently, Nepos has sent a missive to me requesting the East's aid in once again reclaiming Italy, but our resources are stretched thin as it is. How much am I willing to commit to his endeavor?"

 western_roman.0031.desc:0 "The rebuilding of a temple for the Jews on the Temple Mount would not only bolster their status as a counterweight to the rising influence of Christianity, but also give the lie to Jesus' prophecy that the temple would never again be rebuilt. While a reconstruction of such a grand structure will take much time and effort, this would greatly help my efforts in reconverting the empire back to the old ways. To lead such a grand and controversial reconstruction requires someone skilled at both building and protecting the project during its lifetime. Who should I choose as the project leader?"

 western_roman.0033.desc:0 "The cause of the fires has been found -- it was sabotage! A strange mix of Christians determined to uphold the prophecy and Jews who believed that gentiles should have had no part in the reconstruction of the Temple had conspired to repeatedly damage our project. With the saboteurs now punished, however, construction can continue apace."
 western_roman.0033.a:0 "I shall tolerate no more delays."

 western_roman.0034.t:0 "Fire!"
 western_roman.0034.desc:0 "More fires have broken out! Surely this can't be natural? Rumors say that this is the will of God, however my spies inform me that this may be the work of renegades seeking to sabotage my reconstruction efforts..."

 western_roman.0034.b:0 "Continue at a slower pace."
 western_roman.0034.c:0 "This has become too expensive; cancel the project."

 western_roman.0035.t:0 "Earthquake!"

Throngs of Jews, newly allowed back into Jerusalem, raucously cheer my entourage as I wind my way up to the temple for the grand opening. After withstanding sabotage and natural disasters alike, I have finally overturned Jesus' prophecy and dealt a serious blow both for the Jews and against the Christians."
