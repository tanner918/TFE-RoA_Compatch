# Events 

 disaster.0010.t:0 "The Dust Veil"
 disaster.0010.desc:0 "During this year a most dread portent took place, for the sun gave forth its light without brightness like the moon during this whole year. It seemed like the sun was in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear and from the time when this thing happened, men were neither free from war nor pestilence nor any other thing leading to death."
 disaster.0010.a:0 "A divine sign!"
 disaster.0010.b:0 "A bothersome omen at best"
 disaster.0011.t:0 "An Earthquake in Latium"
 # Descritpion by Sethos
 disaster.0011.desc:0 "Today, in the middle of the night, the earth herself trembled. The aftermath was devastating. Reports of houses collapsing on unsuspecting families and fires breaking out throughout the lands of Latium have come piling in. Homes, marketplaces, and places of worship that were once sturdy and proud are now in complete ruins. Even the walls of the great Colosseum in Rome have not gone unscathed... This desolation has left countless wounded, homeless or dead." 
 disaster.0011.a:0 "What would Titus do..."
 disaster.0012.t:0 "Crop Misrotation"
 disaster.0012.desc:0 "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]! Concerning reports from the countryside have arrived. After years of pristine high yields, agricultural laborers in Latium apparently lost all output. According to their missive, an outbreak of fever has decimated the population after an onset of floods inflicted damage to their fields. Our steward suspects that their stupidity led them to skip fallow rotation. As a consequence, there is neither any able laborer nor any suitable land to work on anymore; everything lies in ruins and a response is needed to alleviate the crisis."
 disaster.0012.a:0 "Greed is a sin, and their downfall is of no concern to us."
 disaster.0012.b:0 "We should send relief aid immediately!"

The Skirtos river, the bloodvein of the city, played a bad trick upon the citizens. The city was flooded in a matter of hours. It started in a bath house, where the doors were blasted by the waters.

 ash.0002.t:0 "Endless Winter"
 ash.0002.desc:0 "It should be summer by now- but is nearly as cold now as six months earlier. The sun is blurred, blue,  and heatless, and even at noon no shadows are cast. In all of recorded history, barring the oldest and most fantastical of myths, no memory of a summer this cold can be found. The harvest will fail. Where there is peace, and a previous year of prosperity, people will not starve, but nowhere is a cold sun a good omen. Where there is strife or plague, these years without a summer might spell true disaster."

ash.0004.desc:"It took half a thousand people, and half a year. It towers higher than 8 men, and is ten men's height in cross-width. 30,000 young trees were cut for the mound. Finally, the burial is complete.  A great feast is held, and what is left of the dead is placed into the mound and covered up, while great and fervent prayers are said. The sun seems to brighten, for a moment. The next day, it is as darkened as ever."
