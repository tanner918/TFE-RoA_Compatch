As you turn a corner, you collide with a shadowy, cloaked figure, sending both of you sprawling on the ground. You reach out to help the other to their feet, but as you do so, a posse of watchmen and their guard dogs come hurtling down the street, pausing and regarding the pair of you with suspicion. Their leader steps forward and asks if I have seen an escaped slave from the gladiator ranks anywhere, his eyes lingering on my companion. I spot a glint of armor underneath the cloak. Could this figure be their quarry?"
