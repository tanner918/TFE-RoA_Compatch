 # GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR QUOTES
 # 
 # - One quote per person/source to ensure variety
 # - Try to include quotes from a variety of regions for diversity

 # Cybrxkhan: This is just some general guidelines I use when selecting quotes. You don't have to follow them as this is just a suggestion,
 # but since I've added the vast majority of the quotes here, I have tried to keep them consistent in such a way.
