This means it is possible to grant land to a [religion|E] you don't follow.\n\nDoing so grants you a [character_modifier|E] boosting [opinion|E] for followers of that [religion|E] and adds [county_modifiers|E] to your [counties|E] with several benefits. The [county_modifier|E] reduces [tax|E] but increase and [development_growth|E]. If you follow a [faith|E] of the [religion|E] you chose, the [modifier|E] also improves [county_opinion|E], while if you don't, the [modifier|E] improves [development_growth|E] even more instead. Qualifying [counties|E] with a [church_holding|E] receive a more powerful version of the [modifier|E] you get.\n\nAdditionally, in affected [counties|E], the [decision|E] has a small chance of adding [minority_faiths|E] of a random [faith|E] of the [religion|E] you chose, or, even more rarely, outright converting the [counties|E] to that [faith|E]."

Veneration of nature is prominent, and the old Iranian deity Mithra, or Mehr, plays an key cosmological role as the demiurge and common object of worship – a role that might have inspired the Roman Cult of Mithras centuries before."
