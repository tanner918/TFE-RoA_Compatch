Over the years, his journey to the Western Regions would take him across many kingdoms, cities, and lands. The record of his travels would later inspire one of the so-called #italic Four Great Classical Novels#! of Chinese literature.#!\n\nXuanzang recorded information about the lives, cultures, and beliefs of the tapestry of peoples who dwelled across Asia during this period. New empires, specifically the Tang Dynasty, Arab Caliphate, and Tibet, are on the rise, hungry to control the wealth of the Silk Road; smaller states seek to survive the crossfire, or become powerful empires of their own. Meanwhile, new faiths, artistic traditions, and ideas spread across the region's trade routes.\n\n#bold The Silk Road is at a crossroads. What will Xuanzang record about the region when he returns home to China?#!"
