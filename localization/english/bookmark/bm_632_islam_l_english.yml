 bm_632_islam_desc:0 "On the 8th of June, 632 AD, the Prophet Muhammed died, having spread the religion of Islam across much of Arabia through his efforts at growing his number of followers. With his passing, Abu Bakr succeeds him as the first of the Caliphs, uniting the Arabian peninsula under one leader and one faith.\n\nPrior to his death, the Prophet sent emissaries to the two strongest powers to the north of Arabia, the Eastern Roman and the Sassanid Empires, beseeching them to convert to Islam; both had rejected the Prophet's call to convert, and so Caliph Abu Bakr finds his Rashidun Caliphate on the precipice of war.\n\n#bold Will Allah guide the faithful towards victory, or will the Sword of Islam remain within the Arabian desert?#!"
