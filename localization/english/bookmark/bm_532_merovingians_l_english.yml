 #bm_532_reconquest_desc:1 "It has been five decades since the loss of Italia. The lands, once undivided extensions of Rome, are now in the hands of pretenders claiming to be successors to the Roman Empire. These Goths and the rest of the barbarians rule each over their limited domains. Five years have passed since a new emperor ascended to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire - Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled and with the help of his talented generals, Justinian has triumphed over his Sassanian rivals in the battle of Dara and revised Roman law in its entirety. Recently, Justinian faced and crushed a revolt against him; victorious, Justinian's ambitions are rekindled. The empire's goal and purpose are now clear - the reclamation of the entirety of Rome and the restoration of an era now regarded as the days of the good emperors. \n\n#bold Will the Romans triumph, earning their leaders the nickname "Last of the Romans"? Or will they truly be the last Romans?#!"
 bm_532_merovingians_desc:0 "After the Battle of Soissons in 486 AD saw the downfall of the last Western Roman rump state, the Franks cemented their rule across Northern Gaul and the land around the River Rhine. The Kingdom of the Franks, under the founder of the Merovingian Dynasty, Clovis I, remained restless after the downfall of Syagrius's regime. \n\n By the time of Clovis's death in 511 AD and the partition of the Frankish realm amongst themselves, the Alemanni tribes of Eastern Gaul and the Visigothic holdings in Aquitania fell under the Merovingian banner, and the Frankish people became firm adherents of Nicene Christianity after his conversion in 496. \n\n#bold Although the Kingdom of the Franks remains divided amongst Clovis's sons, it may not remain so if one of them is both ambitious and capable enough to pursue reunification . . ."

 # Clothar

 bookmark_merovingian_clothar_desc:0 "Though the youngest of Clovis' surviving sons, Clothar is no less capable than his brothers. He would spend most of his life expanding his realm at the expense of both his relatives and other, neighboring kingdoms. Eventually, he would rule over a reunified Frankish realm in 558 AD, after the deaths of his brothers and their heirs. However, the Franks would be divided once again with Clothar's death in 561.\n\n#bold As Clothar, can you not only reunify the realm your father worked so hard to forge together, but keep it unified for years to come?#!"

 # Theodoric

 bookmark_merovingian_theodoric_desc:0 "As the eldest of Clovis' sons, Theodoric not only inherited the lion's share of his father's territories, but was also the only son of Clovis who was an adult when Clovis passed away. In fact, he was a veteran of many of his father's wars by the time he became king. Yet, despite such advantages, it would be his youngest brother Clothar who would eventually reunite the Frankish realm, and not him nor his descendants.\n\n#bold You are the eldest brother, who had served under your father dutifully. Can you assert your authority over your lesser, younger brothers, or will they be too much for you to handle?#!"

 # Childebert

 bookmark_merovingian_childebert_desc:0 "Like his brothers, Childebert is ruler of action, using his military and political ability to expand the Franks' rule across Western Europe. As the most religious of his brothers, he was responsible for constructing the famed abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, which would house a fragment of the True Cross and a fragment of the tunic of the martyr Saint Vincent, two relics he had captured during his wars against the Visigoths.\n\n#bold Clovis' conversion was a turning point in the history of the Franks. Can you ensure your father's military and religious legacy?#!"
