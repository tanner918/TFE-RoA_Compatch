 bm_532_legacy_of_theodoric_desc:0 "By the time of his death on the 30th of August, 526 AD, Theodoric 'the Great' ruled an empire stretching from the Atlantic to the Adriatic, as King of the Ostrogoths in Italia and as Regent of the Visigoths. Having upheld the legal administration of the former Western Roman Empire and encouraged the growth of a scholarly culture within his domain, Theodoric has left a significant legacy that his successors now must seek to preserve or even exceed. \n\n#bold However, that legacy is under threat from the inept rule of his grandson in Italia, the tenuous position Theudis of the Visigoths finds himself in against his Hispano-Roman subjects, and the ambitions of Imperator Iustinianius to reconquer the west in the name of the Roman Empire. How will you handle the legacy of Theodoric 'the Great'?"

 # Athalaric, Ostrogothic king

 bookmark_theodoric_athalaric_desc:0 "When Theodoric the Great died in 526 AD, his grandson Athalaric succeeded him, with his daughter Amalasuntha as regent. The young king supposedly indulged in drink and women, leading to his early demise in 534. His mother became queen, and made her cousin Theodahad co-ruler, but he turned against her. Her murder gave the Romans justification to begin their invasion of Italia, thus starting the long, devastating Gothic Wars.\n\n#bold Regardless of his personal qualities, Athalaric had big shoes to fill, being in the shadow of his esteemed grandfather. Could his survival have changed the fate of Italia and the Ostrogoths?#!"

 # Gelimer, last Vandal

 bookmark_theodoric_gelimer_desc:0 "When Gelimer's cousin Hilderic converted to Chalcedonian Christianity, the Vandal nobility, which was mainly Arian, supported Gelimer in deposing his cousin. The Romans used this as a pretext to attack the Vandals in 533 AD. Despite stubborn resistance, Gelimer lost heart when his brothers Ammatas and Tzazo were killed in separate battles. According to Procopius, after he surrendered to the Romans and was allowed to retire to an estate in Galatia, he cried out a Biblical verse during Belisarius' triumph in Constantinople: 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!'\n\n#bold The Romans will stop at nothing to reclaim their old territories. Can you stop them in their tracks?#!"

 # Iabdas, Berber chief who held back Romans for a while

 bookmark_theodoric_iabdas_desc:0 "During the Roman reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals, many local Berber chieftains initially remained neutral. Some, like Iabdas, even resisted the Empire. From his base in the Aurès mountains, he led numerous attacks against imperial forces. In 539 AD, he even lost his treasury and wives to the Roman general Solomon, and was wounded by a javelin, only to reemerge years later to avenge himself by slaying Solomon in battle.\n\n#bold Iabdas eventually accepted Roman tutelage, but was a thorn in their side for many years. Can you surpass his tenacity, and drive out the Romans for good?#!"

 # Masuna, Altava ally

 bookmark_theodoric_masuna_desc:0 "The Mauro-Roman Kingdom emerged in Mauretania with the collapse of Roman authority there. Masuna, their first ruler known by name, submitted to the Romans, during their reconquest of North Africa, in exchange for military aid against the Vandals. He was far from a passive ally, however, demanding gifts and symbols of office in return.\n\n#bold Will you continue aiding the Romans in restoring their authority in North Africa, or will you take your kingdom, home to both Roman and Moorish peoples, in a new direction?#!"

 # Theudis, King of the Visigoths
 bookmark_theodoric_theudis:0 " King Theudis"
 bookmark_theodoric_theudis_desc:0 "Theudis, sword-bearer of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, had been appointed as regent to the child king Amalaric of the Visigoths, who was Theodoric's grandson. When he came of age, Amalaric, a zealous Arian, invited the ire of the Chalcedonian Franks, who attacked him. Amalaric was then assassinated by his own men, rather conveniently for Theudis, who was subsequently elected king of Visigoths. Theudis would later defeat the Franks in battle, but was himself assassinated in 548 AD.\n\n#bold Though you are an Ostrogoth, can you bring prosperity and security to the Visigoths and Romans you rule over in these uncertain times?#!"
