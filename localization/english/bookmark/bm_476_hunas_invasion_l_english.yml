 bm_476_hunas_invasion_desc:0 "Not long after Attila 'the Hun' ravaged the frontiers of the Western Roman Empire, several waves of Eastern or Iranian Huns (referred to as the "Hunas") began to ravage the Gupta Empire's northern territories. The first Hunas were the Kidarites, but more followed, undermining Kidarite influence on the subcontinent. Although Samrat Skandagupta repelled a Hunnic force in 455 AD and the Sassanids followed suit in 467 AD, the Hephthalites and Alchon Huns continue to pose a threat from Punjab and the lands farther north.\n\n#bold The Huna invasions and the decline of the Guptas have created a new struggle for power on the Gangetic Plain. Can you bring glory to your dynasty in these challenging times?"

 bookmark_hunas_invasion_budhagupta_desc:0 "While Budhagupta's uncle, Skandagupta, proved himself as one of the last great Gupta Emperors by repelling an invasion of the Hunas, Budhagupta's history would not be quite as illustrious. He inherited an empire in decline, one which was losing control over its western territories to the encroaching Hunas.\n\n#bold Skandagupta, it turns out, only halted the advance of the Hunas for a while. Can you reverse your dynasty's fortunes by repelling the Hunas as your uncle once did, and restore the Guptas to their former glory?#!"

 # Khingila

 bookmark_hunas_invasion_khingila_desc:0 "Khingila was the first great king of the Alchon Huns, one of the Eastern Hunnic tribes. Under his leadership, the Alchons began their invasion of India, destroying their predecessors the Kidarites, and bringing the once mighty Gupta Empire to its knees. His successors would continue his conquests, particularly Mihirakula, who is vilified in Buddhist sources as a cruel warlord.\n\n#bold Do you have what it takes to recreate the meteoric rise of the Alchon Huns, and surpass their historic achievements by bringing all of the Gangetic Plain under your heel?#!"

 bookmark_hunas_invasion_skandavarman_desc:0 "The Tamil people have faced their own barbarians in the form of the Kalabhras for the past two centuries, and the Pallavas have been the only ones to escape their onslaught. Skandavarman rules in Tondai Nadu as a petty king, and will be known to history as merely one of the many minor Pallavas before the coming of the great Mahendravarman.\n\n#bold Can you usher in the Pallava golden age early by carving a kingdom from the Pennar to the Ponnaiyar, or even take it further by conquering all of Tamilakam?#!"

 # Harishena

 bookmark_hunas_invasion_harishena_desc:0 "The Vakataka states of the Deccan underwent a slow decline due to the division of their empire after the death of Samrat Pravarasena. Raja Harishena's Vatsagulma branch expanded by conquering two branches of the family in the south. He would conquer the Nandivardhana's state in 480, but the fortunes of the Vakatakas would not reverse. Harishena is the last recorded ruler of the dynasty, and Maharashtra would become a slew of petty kingdoms until the rise of the Chalukyas.\n\n#bold Can you mimic his conquest of the Nandivardhana pretenders and surpass him by reviving the grip of the Vakataka Dynasty over Maharashtra and beyond?#!"

 # Kassapa

 bookmark_hunas_invasion_kassapa_desc:0 "Though far from the ravages of the Hunas, Sri Lanka is no stranger to chaos. The current king, Kassapa, is greatly reviled for overthrowing and killing his father, king Dhatusena. Not only is the rightful heir, Kassapa's brother Moggallana, still alive, but patricide is one of the most heinous offenses among the Buddhists who dominate the island. Kassapa would later build the infamous rock fortress of Sigiriya; this did not deter Moggallana, who defeated Kassapa in battle and avenged their father.\n\n#bold Can you survive as the unrightful king, or will your past karma catch up with you, and send you to the depths of hell?#!"

 bookmark_hunas_invasion_kunkhas_desc:0 "Once a greatly feared tribe in Central Asia, the Kidarites swept aside the remnants of the Kushans, and fought toe-to-toe with the Sassanids. Kunkhas, their last attested ruler, controlled a rump state in northern India that was threatened and eventually engulfed by other Hunnic groups like the Alchons and Hephthalites who were on the rise.\n\n#bold Reclaiming your former empire in Central Asia might be a lost dream, but perhaps you can survive elsewhere; can you carve a new destiny for the Kidarites in India?#!"
