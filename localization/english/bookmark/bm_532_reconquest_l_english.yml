 bm_532_reconquest:0 "The Last of the Romans"
 #bm_532_reconquest_desc:1 "It has been five decades since the loss of Italia. The lands, once undivided extensions of Rome, are now in the hands of pretenders claiming to be successors to the Roman Empire. These Goths and the rest of the barbarians rule each over their limited domains. Five years have passed since a new emperor ascended to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire - Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled and with the help of his talented generals, Justinian has triumphed over his Sassanian rivals in the battle of Dara and revised Roman law in its entirety. Recently, Justinian faced and crushed a revolt against him; victorious, Justinian's ambitions are rekindled. The empire's goal and purpose are now clear - the reclamation of the entirety of Rome and the restoration of an era now regarded as the days of the good emperors. \n\n#bold Will the Romans triumph, earning their leaders the nickname "Last of the Romans"? Or will they truly be the last Romans?#!"
 bm_532_reconquest_desc:0 "It has been five decades since Roman power collapsed in the west. Once united under the banner of the Roman aquila, Western Europe is now divided among competing Germanic kingdoms, and the final Western Roman outposts in Soissons and Illyria had been subdued by their neighbors; only the Eastern Roman Empire stands as the last bastion of the glory of Rome. \n\nFive years have now passed since Flavius Petrus Sabbatius ascended to the purple as Imperator Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled over the empire from Constantinople, he revised Roman law in its entirety through the #italic Corpus Juris Civilis#!, quashed the Nika Riots, and repelled a Sassanid assault on his eastern border - particularly with the military genius of his general, Flavius Belisarius. \n\n#bold Iustinianus has long dreamed of restoring Roman rule to the west, and is now intent on dispatching Belisarius to lead the reconquest of the former Western Roman Empire. Will the aquila fly over Italia, Africa, and Hispania, or will it remain dormant in the east?"

 bookmark_reconquest_belisarius_desc:0 "From a young age, Belisarius has been present on the field of battle, from numerous campaigns against the Visigoths in Iberia to his great triumph over the Sassanian army at Dara. Belisarius proved to be a very capable soldier and commander; he crushed the Nika Riots, saving Iustinianus's rule while leading no more then 300 soldiers against an unruly crowd of 30,000. In the aftermath of the riots, Iustinianus summoned Belisarius and tasked him with another daring task -- an invasion of the Vandalic Kingdom. \n\n#bold 'Known to historians as 'Last of the Romans', your skill at commanding armies is undeniable. Be wary, however, of those who may become wary of your growing prestige and may seek to poison Iustinianus against you...'#!"

 bookmark_reconquest_justinian_desc:0 "Iustinianus was Emperor of the Roman Empire from 527 until his death in 565 AD. During his reign, he quelled the Nika Riots, secured his border with the Sassanid Empire, codified Roman law in the #italic Corpus Juris Civilis#!, oversaw construction of the current edifice of the Hagia Sophia, and ushered in the reconquest of North Africa, Italia, and part of Hispania. After his death, however, his successors failed to secure his gains, and by the dawn of the 8th century, the empire lost more than half of its territory to invaders. \n\n#bold Will you too usher the empire in a restoration of its territories and secure them for centuries to come, or will you and your successors eventually lose all that the empire fought and bled for?"

 bookmark_reconquest_mundus_desc:0 "Hailing from a proud Gepid and Hunnic lineage, Mundus swiftly climbed the ranks in the Eastern Roman military, securing a pivotal position under Emperor Iustinianus. His youth as a bandit along the Danube, marked by audacious exploits and strategic acumen, shaped him into a relevant figure who gained the attention of Theodoric the Great. Recently, as a Gepid outsider in the imperial court, he was responsible, along with Belisarius, for crushing the Nika riots. \n\n#bold Will Mundus prove indispensable to the emperor's ambitions, or will the complexities of Roman bureaucracy unravel his ascent, forcing him to look to his old home in the Gepid Kingdom?"

 bookmark_reconquest_john_cappadocian_desc:0 "Ioannes, a native of the city of Caesarea in Cappadocia, rose quickly in the Eastern Roman bureaucracy thanks to his administrative and financial skills. However, he also resorted to methods perceived as unfriendly by the population, according to his political enemies. His rapid ascent and favor with Emperor Iustinianus earned him the enmity of several people, but neither this nor the Nika riots could remove him from the government. \n\n#bold Can Ioannes of Cappadocia continue to increase his influence in the empire, or will he finally be ousted by his enemies?"
