 bm_361_storm_in_the_east_desc:1 "As the Roman Empire continues to contend with its slow decline amidst Germanic incursions and the machinations of ambitious politicans, little attention is given to the lands formerly ruled by the Scythians.\n\nWith the power of the Xiongnu left in tatters, one of its splinter branches, the Huns, have made their way across the Ural Mountains and toward the banks of the Volga River, threatening the position of the Ostrogoths and coming dangerously close to the boundaries of the Sassanid and Roman Empires.\n\n#bold The Huns have arrived. Soon, Europe will tremble beneath their hooves. The only question remains: will you be on their side, or die trying to resist them?"

His exploits and tragic end were the subject of many later Germanic legends. Purportedly, he either committed suicide or was wounded severely when the Huns launched a massive attack onto his territories. He would not live to see how they ravaged across Europe.\n\n#bold Stand fast, stand true, for the Huns are coming: can you do what seems impossible, and defeat their unrelenting horde?#!"

If he was real, then he was the ruler who led the Huns to defeat the Ostrogoths, establishing the Huns as peoples to be feared, and setting in motion the chain of events that would lead to the great wars and migrations of the late 4th and 5th centuries.\n\n#bold The Huns are here, and at the head of their fearsome host is none other than you.

This ruler is fictional.#!\n\nThe future Hungary, in Pannonia, is not even a distant dream at this point in the early history of the Magyars. Currently, they dwell in what would later be known as #italic Magna Hungaria#!, the supposed original homeland of the Magyars. Here, on the steppes not too far from the Urals, they would take on influences from their Turkic and Iranian neighbors before their trek westwards.\n\n#bold Will you lead the Magyars on their historical path to Hungary, or will you strike a different route across the steppes?#!"
