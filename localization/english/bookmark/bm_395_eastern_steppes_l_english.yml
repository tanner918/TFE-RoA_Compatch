Meanwhile, along the Hexi Corridor and the Tarim Basin, warlords seek to restore order in the frontier of the still divided Middle Kingdom.\n\n#bold Diviners say that great kingdoms will soon emerge from the ashes and ruins of the Han and the Xiongnu.

Shelun and his brothers fled to their uncle Pihouba, but mutual distrust led to conflict and Pihouba's death. He then united many steppe tribes through cunning and force, taking on the name of "Qiudoufa Khagan," as the first of the Rouran khagans who reigned from 402 until his death in 410. He and his successors would turn the Rouran into the bane of the Northern Wei and many other peoples.\n\n#bold Your old nemesis, the Northern Wei, watches with wary eyes, waiting as you plot your next move. How will you avenge your older brother, and conquer the steppes?#!"

 bookmark_eastern_steppes_li_gao_desc:0 "Li Gao hails from the Longxi Li clan, which claims descent from the sage Laozi and the great Han general Li Guang. He once lived with Song Yao, his half-brother, and Guo Nen, a mystic and minister of the Later Liang Dynasty. During that time, Guo prophesied, correctly, that Li would found an independent state once a mare gave birth to a pony with a white forehead. Though Li's Western Liang dynasty was shortlived, lasting from 400 to 421, his descendants later founded the Tang Dynasty.\n\n#bold In Liang province, a mare has been spotted giving birth to a pony with a white forehead.

After Lü wrongly executed two of Juqu Mengxun's uncles, Juqu Mengxun and his brother Nancheng persuaded one of Lü's governors, Duan Ye, to rebel in 397 and found a new dynasty, Northern Liang. To then take power for himself, Mengxun tricked Duan Ye into executing Nancheng, before he killed Duan Ye too. Though a capable if cruel ruler, after his death in 433, his state was conquered by the Northern Wei and Rouran.\n\n#bold What plots, schemes, and betrayals will you make use of to reenact Juqu Mengxun's rise to power?#!"

Originally a general of the Di people serving under the Former Qin Dynasty, he won many victories in the Western Regions. When Former Qin collapsed after the Battle of Fei River in 383, Lü founded a new dynasty, Later Liang. Yet Later Liang quickly collapsed itself. Many of Lü's officials and generals rose in rebellion, while his weakling heir, Shao, was couped by his ruthless brother Zuan, who in turn was couped by his cousins, leading to Later Liang's demise in 403.\n\n#bold Your control over Later Liang is slipping away – fast.

He fled to the Northern Wei court where he received imperial favor thanks to his accurate divinations; his descendants would attain important official posts in various dynasties in northern China for several generations afterwards.\n\n#bold It is ironic that Beihouli could save others with his divinations, but not himself.

In other words, the city was deserted by the Buddha and no longer worthy of his protection. Lü Guang killed the old king and installed his brother, Bai Zhen, on the throne. Yet Later Liang's supremacy was shortlived. It collapsed due to internal unrest and revolt in 403, and Kucha was freed from its yoke.\n\n#bold Under your rule, can Kucha restore its sovereignity, and become a city worthy of the Golden Man, the Buddha, once more?#!"
