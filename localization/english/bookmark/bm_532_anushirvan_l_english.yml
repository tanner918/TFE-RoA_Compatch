 bm_532_anushirvan_desc:0 "Under Khosrau I, the Sassanids would reach dazzling heights of power. Yet, in 532 AD, his reign is only beginning. He has just negotiated a so-called Perpetual Peace with the Romans, but everyone knows this peace will not last long.\n\nBesides the Romans to the west, there are dangerous enemies to the east, too. The Alchon Huns under Mihirakula recently suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the brilliant Indian king Yashodharman, but the other major Eastern Hun tribe, the Hephthalites, remains strong. In the steppes, there are rumblings of discontent within the once mighty Rouran, as new clans like the Ashina rise to the forefront.\n\n#bold The stage is set for a clash of titans in the Middle East and Central Asia. Even if the Sassanids overcome these threats, will they have the strength to survive what comes after?#!"

Known for his virtue, intelligence, and ambition, few Ērānian monarchs could match him in glory.\n\n#bold Khosrau would be known to posterity as 'Anushirvan,' meaning immortal soul.

Yet now, he is a broken old man. Only a few years ago, he was defeated by King Yashodharman in battle, which ended Hunnic hegemony over Northern India. He would soon die afterwards.\n\n#bold Though you are a shadow of your former self, do you, or at least your descendants, still have the ruthlessness needed to reclaim your lost glory, and make the people of India fear the Huns once more?#!"

His Aulikara Dynasty is in the ascendancy, as he is swiftly reuniting much of Northern India after the disintegration of the Gupta Empire. Yet, after his death around 540 AD, the Aulikaras would immediately collapse.\n\n#bold You've earned immortality by defeating the Huns. Can you now achieve the greater challenge of creating an empire that will last for generations?#!"

For whatever reason, Gatfar humilited Katulf by violating his wife, and Katulf defected to the Sassanids, playing a role in the Hephthalite's downfall.\n\n#bold Will you protect the Hephthalites from their foes, even if your king refuses to heed your counsel and openly disrespects you, or will you be pushed to the limits of your patience, and be forced to betray your people?#!"

The Göktürks would then dominate Central Asia for almost two centuries.\n\n#bold It is said that the Göktürks' revolt was triggered when the Rouran khagan insulted Bumin by denigrating him as a "blacksmith slave."
