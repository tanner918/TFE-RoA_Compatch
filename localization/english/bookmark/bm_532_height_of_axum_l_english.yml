 bm_532_height_of_axum_desc:0 "Mani, the 3rd century prophet and founder of Manicheism, claimed that there were four great empires in the world: Roma, Ērānšahr, China, and Aksum. Aksum would reach its zenith under the 6th century King, Kaleb, who conquered Himyar.\n\nNow, Aksum may be reaching its limits. Its control over Himyar is unraveling, as Ethiopian and Yemenite warlords seek power there. It also has to balance the competing geopolitical interests of Rome and Ērān, and religious tensions between the region's Christians, Jews, and pagans.\n\n#bold Will Aksum overcome these hardships, or will a different power – or even a different faith – take its place as the master of the Red Sea?#!"

 # Kaleb, Aksumite Emperor

 bookmark_axum_kaleb_desc:0 "Kaleb's conquest of Yemen, in defense of the local Christian population persecuted by the Jewish Himyarite king, Dhu Nuwas, was undoubtedly a spectacular deed. However, Yemen quickly collapsed into anarchy, and Kaleb's expedition overextended Aksum, to the point where it would never project its power this far again. According to Ethiopian tradiiton, Kaleb would eventually abdicate his throne, retire to a monastery, and become Saint Elesbaan.\n\n#bold Despite achieving so much, Kaleb's accomplishments are slipping away. Can you stabilize the situation in Yemen, so that your great expedition was not in vain?#!"

For instance, he converted the Temple of Dendur – an important pagan temple commissioned by Emperor Augustus – into a Church. Nobatia weakened under his successors, as it was annexed by neighboring Makuria by the 7th century.\n\n#bold The Nobatian kings' legacy was the Christianization of Nubia. Can you ensure that they accomplish more than just that?#!"

 bookmark_axum_kharakhen_desc:0 "Under mighty chiefs like Kharakhen, the Blemmye tribes of the Eastern Desert pose a formidable menace to their neighbors. They are powerful enough that the staunchly Christian Romans allow them to make pilgrimage to the temple of Philae, in southern Egypt, to worship there as the ancients did. This arrangement, however, would not last long as Philae's pagan temple was officially closed in 537 CE.\n\n#bold As a holdout of the traditional faiths related to ancient Egyptian and Nubian paganism, how will you assert the Blemmyes' independence in the face of the resurgence of Roman, Aksumite, and Nubian power?#!"

His exploits in the Arabian peninsula were so legendary, that he is even mentioned in the Quran. However, in the wake of the Aksumite conquest and the collapse of Himyar, Yemen is in a state of chaos, as Abraha fights with Himyarite warlords and nobles who seek to expel him to take power for themselves.\n\n#bold Though you are partly responsible for the chaos, can you restore order to Himyar, and establish a new, Christian kingdom in Yemen?#!"

His failed revolt against Abraha in 532 was backed by two prominent Himyarite nobles: Ma'dikarib, son of the puppet king of Himyar that Abraha overthrew, and Murra Dhu Yazan, a powerful noble humiliated by Araha when Abraha took his wife, Rihana, for himself.\n\n#bold Abraha has brought nothing but war and instability to his new kingdom.

According to legend, his father, Hujr, disapproved of his son's hedonistic lifestyle and love of poetry, wine, and women, and banished him from his kingdom. Yet when the tribe of Asad killed his father, he renounced wine and women to fight and slay many of the Asad in revenge. He then wandered the Middle East, supposedly as far as Constantinople, to find supporters to help him reclaim his birthright.\n\n#bold As a poet, your words will inspire Arabs for generations.

 # Around 525 AD, at the request of the Christian community of Yemen and the Byzantine Empire, Kaleb sent Aksumite forces to overthrow the Jewish King of Himyar, Dhu Nuwas, and conquer his lands, bringing Aksum to its greatest extent.
# In the 6th century, during the reign of $emperor_feudal_male_ethiopian$ Kaleb, Aksum was experiencing its zenith. Militarily, he expanded the kingdom into Yemen, while trade flowed across the Indian Ocean, bringing untold riches into the Ethiopian highlands. Petty chiefs across the region, pagan, Christian, and Jewish alike, from the fearsome Beja nomads to the cosmopolitan urbanites of Himyar, paid tribute to mighty Aksum.
