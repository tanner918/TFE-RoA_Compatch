 bm_361_nile_desc:1 "Civilization was born along the banks of the Nile over three millennia ago. For centuries, the god-kings of Egypt and Kush inspired awe and fear. Now, the region is in turmoil, as the Kushite Empire collapses, and worship of the old gods declines.\n\nYet though this might be the end of an ancient legacy, life always finds a way along the Nile. Perhaps a new sun will rise on a new Nile, and new kingdoms and new faiths will revive this venerable land.\n\n#bold The Pharaohs, Qores, and Candaces who ruled the Nile pass into history, and a new age dawns. The shape of the future, the fate of the Nile – will these be yours to decide?#!"

 # Amanipilade, possibly the last known king/queen of Kush/Meroe
 bookmark_nile_amanipilade:0 "Queen Amanipilade"
 bookmark_nile_amanipilade_desc:0 "The kingdom of Kush, or Meroe, may have collapsed from both internal disintegration and foreign incursions by Axum and the Noubades. We know little about Amanipilade, the final royal buried in the pyramids of Meroe, as even her gender is debated. Whether she was a warlord in a post-Meroitic power vacuum, or the last attested ruler of Kush, she was the dying breath of an old world.\n\n#bold As the final heir of ancient Nilotic civilization, and over a hundred generations of ancient Egyptian and Kushite royal tradition, are you doomed to fade into the chaos of obscurity?#!"

 #  As she faded into the dust of history, so too would more than a hundred generations of ancient Egyptian and Kushite royal tradition.\n\n#bold You are the final heir of more than three millennia of Nilotic civilization. It is up to you to reverse that fate, and restore order to a world.

 # Yisemeniye, one of the earliest attested Beja kings
 bookmark_nile_yisemeniye:0 "King Yisemeniye"
 bookmark_nile_yisemeniye_desc:0 "As Meroe collapsed, the Beja, or Blemmyes, would expand their influence across much of Nubia under ambitious leaders like Yisemeniye, one of their earliest attested kings. Though the extent of his power is uncertain, he and his successors held tenuous sway over a number of other Beja tribes. He, like later Beja kings, venerated the ancient Nilotic gods by leaving inscriptions at and even going on pilgrimage to the ancient temples by Aswan.\n\n#bold Will the Blemmyes triumph over the remnants of Meroe, and honor the old gods to become the new rulers of the Nile?#!"

 # Mehadeyis, Axumite king who succeeded the famous Ezana

 bookmark_nile_mehadeyis_desc:0 "King Ezana's conversion to Christianity in the early 4th century was a watershed moment in the history of Christendom, for it gave the new, growing religion its first powerful patron: Aksum. Ezana's military adventures in the collapsing Kushite Empire only furthered Aksumite glory. His successor, Mehadeyis, sits atop the throne of a mighty state, with the potential to expand its horizons to dominate the region for centuries to come.\n\n#bold By the might of the Lord of Heaven, now is the time to take ascendant Aksum across the waters of the Red Sea, into the shores of the Nile river, and through the mountains of Abysinnia!#!"

 bookmark_nile_obedianus_desc:0 "Originally a pagan chieftain of the Nabataean Arabs, Obedianus later became a stalwart convert to Christianity. He heroically protected the monasteries of the Sinai against Blemmye attacks. His successors would continue this legacy for generations; even after many converted to Islam centuries later, they maintained a productive relationship with the Christian monks of the Sinai.\n\n#bold Christ calls to you, oh noble chieftain: embrace the word of God and your destiny, and defend the mountain of Moses!#!"

 # Whoever's at Aswan, i.e. the head priests/prophets of Isis, currently Nesmeterpanakhet
 bookmark_nile_smet:0 "Nesmeterpanakhet"
 bookmark_nile_smet_desc:0 "The city of Aswan, along the first cataract, marks the boundary between Egypt and Nubia. In the 4th century, Egyptian paganism declined, but Aswan hosted remnants of pagan worship into the 6th century, thanks in part to a family of priests of Isis who staffed Aswan's ancient temples. Among them was a certain Nesmeterpanakhet; his son, Nesmeterakhem, carved the last known hieroglyphic inscription in history in 394 AD.\n\n#bold These are dark times for those who worship the old gods. Can you survive the tide of the Abrahamic faiths, or will you be the last to write the language of the ancient hieroglyphs?#!"

 bookmark_nile_garamantes_desc:0 "#warning @warning_icon! This ruler is fictional.#!\n\nThe diverse Garamantean tribes flourished for centuries in the Sahara, excelling in agriculture, trade, and raiding their neighbors. A Roman source speaks of an unnamed Garamantean king from the 3rd or 4th century, for example, who was forced into exile but later defeated his foes using hundreds of war dogs. In late antiquity, the growth of the Sahara desert, and collapse of ground water systems, would cause the Garamantes' demise.\n\n#bold Your ancestors created a thriving civilization in Africa.
